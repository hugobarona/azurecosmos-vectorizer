# Azure Cosmos Vectorizer

This is a sample app that enables you to connect to your **Azure Cosmos DB**, query the data, vectorize it using an **Embeddings model** on **Azure OpenAI** and then push it to **Azure AI Search**.
This approach is a workaround to enable RAG on Azure AI (LLMs), given the current limitations on data sources available for built-in vectorization provided by Azure AI Search - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/vector-search-integrated-vectorization#using-integrated-vectorization-during-indexing
